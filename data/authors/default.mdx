# ¡Hola!

I'm Inés, a Software Engineer. My path in the tech world is an exciting journey, currently leading me to the realm of crafting the frontend of major Scandinavian streaming apps.

Alongside my work, I'm pursuing a master's degree in *Interaction Design and User Experience*. One of the motivations behind this pursuit is to bridge the gap between developers and designers, fostering smoother collaborations in the tech world.

When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me sculpting, travelling, and exploring the beautiful culture of Italy, my current home. Join me in this exciting adventure of tech, creativity, and making a positive impact.
