# Introduction

Array manipulation is a fundamental skill in programming, and one common task is dividing an array into smaller subarrays of a specified size. In this blog post, we'll explore the array chunking problem in JavaScript, a challenge that tests your understanding of array iteration and slicing. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or enhancing your algorithmic thinking, mastering array chunking is a valuable addition to your programming toolkit.

## The problem

Given an array and a chunk size, the task is to divide the array into many subarrays, each of length equal to the specified size.

For example:

```javascript
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) // Outputs [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) // Outputs [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 3) // Outputs [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]
```

# Solutions

## Using a While Loop

The first solution employs a while loop to iteratively slice the array into chunks of the specified size that are pushed into a new array. The loop continues until the entire array is fully processed.

```javascript
function chunk(array, size) {
  const chunked = [];
  let index = 0;

  while (index < array.length) {
    chunked.push(array.slice(index, index + size));
    index += size;
  }

  return chunked;
}
```

## Using a For Loop and Dynamic Chunking

The second solution utilizes a for loop to iterate through the array. It dynamically checks the size of the last subarray and decides whether to create a new subarray or add an element to the existing one. This approach avoids the need to slice the array explicitly.

```javascript
function chunk(array, size) {
  const chunked = [];

  for (let element of array) {
    const last = chunked[chunked.length - 1];

    if (!last || last.length === size) {
      chunked.push([element]);
    } else {
      last.push(element);
    }
  }

  return chunked;
}
```

# Conclusion

Array chunking is a versatile problem that demands a thoughtful approach to array manipulation. Both solutions presented here showcase different techniques: one relies on a while loop and slicing, while the other uses a for loop and dynamic chunking. Understanding these methods not only enhances your problem-solving skills but also provides valuable insights into array iteration and manipulation in JavaScript. As you delve into more complex algorithms, the ability to efficiently chunk arrays will undoubtedly become a valuable asset in your programming journey.
