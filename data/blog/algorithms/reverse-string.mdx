# Introduction

The string reverse problem is a common challenge in programming where the goal is to reverse the characters in a string. For example, reversing "Hello" should return "olleH". This problem is frequently used in interviews and coding exercises to assess a candidate's understanding of strings and algorithms in JavaScript.

# Solutions

## 1. Using Built-in Methods

JavaScript provides several built-in methods that make reversing a string straightforward:

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

This method uses `split('')` to convert the string into an array of characters, `reverse()` to reverse the array, and `join('')` to join the array back into a string.

## 2. Using a For Loop

For a more manual approach, a for loop can be used:

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    let reversed = '';
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed += str[i];
    }
    return reversed;
}
```

This approach involves initializing an empty string `reversed` and then iterating backward through the input string, adding each character to `reversed`.

## 3. Using Recursion

Recursion is another technique to reverse a string:

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    if (str === "") {
        return "";
    } else {
        return reverseString(str.substr(1)) + str.charAt(0);
    }
}
```

In this method, the function calls itself with the rest of the string (`str.substr(1)`) and concatenates the first character (`str.charAt(0)`) at the end of each call.

## 4. Using the `reduce()` Method

The `reduce()` method can be used to accumulate characters in reverse order:

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reduce((reversed, character) => character + reversed, '');
}
```

Here, `split('')` converts the string into an array, and `reduce()` is used to accumulate the characters in reverse, starting from an empty string.

# Conclusion

When considering the time complexity, all these methods have a complexity of O(n). The choice of method depends on the specific requirements:

For example, for simplicity and readability, I prefer built-in methods. I am also a fan of the reduce()` method but it might be less intuitive for those unfamiliar with this style.

Ultimately, the best method depends on the context of the problem and the programmer's familiarity with JavaScript methods and paradigms.
